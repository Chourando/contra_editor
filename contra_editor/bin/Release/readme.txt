=========================================================

=========================================================

Information
===========
This editor is made for Contra for the NES, the rom file is
included in this package. You can almost edit all levels,
except level 2 and 4 and only the level elements. So the bridge
script will be executed, and all other enemies will appear
at their default position.

Alpha version
=============
It is really unstable, so watch where do you click or press
or the level can get messed up, that is why I made 2 buttons:
Save BAK and Res BAK
The whole level is green, but you can guess what is what I
think, don't try to place a turret or anything else, because
it needs to be defined correctly in the level (enemy data).

Installation
============
Just place the contra_editor.exe and the Contra.nes.dat and
the PNG (image file) files next to your Contra.nes file, or
else the program will exit when you try to load the map.

Editing
=======
Info:
If you press Res BAK, you can load my edited level, but only
if you didn't made any Save BAK before.

It looks like simple, but not that much.
After editing some details I hope you will figure out why
do some pictures have white squares on the top left corner,
because it is really important when editing.

1. Load the program
2. Click on Load (if you want change the scene to another)
3. Click only on a white square, or else graphics can mess up
4. Change the ID, do not try Length, because it won't work
   properly, and messes up your map.
5. Press the Write Data button and after I recommend press
   the Save BAK button (if you don't see any problems)
6. Close the program if you finished editing
7. Load Contra.nes, enjoy
