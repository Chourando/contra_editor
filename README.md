# Contra and SuperC level editor - NES

## Info
I wrote these editors because I wanted to edit Contra levels, but there was no editor for it.
It is a very basic editor, it has its flaws. The older versions suffered performance issues.
Currently the enemy editing is for Contra only, but it's unfinished and not user friendly.
These tools only work with specific nes roms, they are inclued in the build.

## Projects

###contra_editor
Editor for Contra NES
Level 2 and 4 is not editable

###supercontra_editor
Editor for SuperC NES
Level 2 and 6 is not editable
It doesn't have an enemy editor.

## Usage
1. Load the program
2. Click on Load (if you want change the scene to another)
3. Click only on a white square, or else graphics can mess up
4. Change the ID, do not try Length, because it won't work
   properly, and messes up your map.
5. Press the Write Data button and after I recommend press
   the Save BAK button (if you don't see any problems)
6. Close the program if you finished editing
7. Load Contra.nes, enjoy
